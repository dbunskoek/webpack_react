<p>Getting started with JavaScript can be painful. Technology keeps on improving all the time and it can be difficult to keep up. That is where <em>SurviveJS</em> comes in.</p>
<p>The first book of the series, <em>SurviveJS - Webpack and React</em>, focuses on <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Combined these two technologies provide an excellent starting point for modern web application development. Webpack solves bundling whereas React solves the view.</p>

<p><em>SurviveJS - Webpack and React</em> is the book I wish I had when I bumped into these technologies the first time. It would have saved a lot of time and headache. But worry not. You don&apos;t have to be as unlucky.</p>
<p>I have distilled my knowledge about the topic in this book in an easy to follow format. Following the book you will build a simple Kanban application that can be used for tracking tasks. When ready you can even you use it with your own projects.</p>
<p>The project and book source is available at <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react">GitHub</a>. The book isn&apos;t entirely tutorial-driven. Some parts provide you more general view of the web development scene. For instance I discuss topics such as styling and library authorship in greater detail.</p>
<h2 id="when-will-the-book-be-available-">When will the book be available?</h2>
<p>An early version of the book is already available. I keep track of the status of the book in <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react#progress">the project README</a>. Especially early chapters and a couple of the later ones are in a good condition. Feedback is very welcome.</p>
<p>After initial release and depending on how that goes I will develop new content to the book based on demand. Other installments are possible as well. But this all depends on how well we get started.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-support-">How to support?</h2>
<p>Even though the book is freely available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license, financial support is welcome. It will help me to devote more time improving the content and developing new one. If you think this is a worthy cause, you can purchase <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack">an electronic copy of the book</a>.</p>
