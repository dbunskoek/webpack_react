<p><a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> are some of the newest tools available for a frontend developer. Webpack solves the difficult problem of bundling. Facebook&apos;s React provides immense view productivity. Combined these technologies provide a good starting point for frontend development.</p>
<p><em>SurviveJS - Webpack and React</em> is the book I wish I had when I started delving into the topic. Both come with a learning curve. This book is here to make it more palatable.</p>
<p>I expect you know the basics of JavaScript but beyond that not much is needed. You just need to have patience to work through the book and poke me in case there&apos;s something you don&apos;t understand!</p>

<p>In this project based book I will show you how to develop a Kanban application. You will learn how to set up a Webpack based development environment and understand basics of React. In addition you will be able to deploy your code to production and author your own libraries after you have grasped the concepts discussed in the book.</p>
<p>The project and book source are available at <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react">GitHub</a>. In addition I have linked to the project source and demos on this website.</p>

<p>Even though the book is freely available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license, financial support is welcome. It will allow me to devote more time developing the content. If you think this is a worthy cause, you can purchase <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack">an electronic copy of the book</a>.</p>

I, <a href="https://twitter.com/bebraw">Juho Veps&#xE4;l&#xE4;inen</a>, have been dealing with the web one way or another since the 90s. All hail <em>marquee</em>! I&apos;ve seen the rise of web and JavaScript in particular. Besides React I have extensive experience in Angular, jQuery and various smaller libraries (mapping, charts, whatnot).
</p>

<p>In addition to web development I have worked using C (embedded and systems level) and computer graphics. On backend side I&apos;m most familiar with Node.js although I&apos;ve done some work with PHP and Ruby.</p>
<h2 id="why-was-the-book-written-">Why was the book written?</h2>
<p>I&apos;ve been blogging a few years at <a href="http://nixtu.info/">nixtu.info</a>. This book is an attempt to turn my freelancing career into a different direction. I hope it will yield a good way to combine my interest in technology with writing while helping the community.</p>
<p>This book probably wouldn&apos;t have gotten written in its current form unless I had started <a href="https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/">a cookbook about Webpack and React</a> with <a href="http://www.christianalfoni.com/">Christian Alfoni</a> and received a rejection from a publisher. In addition numerous people have devoted their precious time towards improving the book so thanks for that!</p>
